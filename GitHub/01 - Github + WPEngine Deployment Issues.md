# Github + WPEngine Deployment Issues

## WP File Manager

* [ ] What happens to Uploads folder if we need a latest form demo site. Because we don't have now  WP File Manger in use due to GitHub Actions push.

## Miscellaneous Files

* [ ] What happens to HTML / Notes / VSCode Settings / Other files that are required to be in the project not needed to be pushed to live site. Those will be included full time OR is there a way to not push them to demo site from GitHub repo.

## New Setup From already created GitHub repo

* [ ] The user copying repo cannot have any old folders like Plugins / Mu Plugins / Uploads / Theme folder etc. Else the Git bash will not download the new repo due to overwrite possibility.
